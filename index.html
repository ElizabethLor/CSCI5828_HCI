				<section>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>History shows that past computer makers were unaware and not focused on Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Made their product non human friendly</li>
							<li>Made it hard to use</li>
							<li>Limit the amount of people having access to a computer</li>
							<li>Made it hard to understand and use/manage the computer</li>
						</ul>
						<li>HCI arose as a field from interwined roots in:
						<ul>
							<li>Computer Graphics</li>
							<li>Operating Systems</li>
							<li>Human Factors</li>
							<li>Ergonomics</li>
							<li>Industrial Engineering</li>
							<li>Cognitive Psychology</li>
							<li>The systems part of computer science</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>History Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Computer graphics was born from the use of Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) and pen devices very early in the history of computers.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This lead to the development of several HCI techniques.</il>
						</ul>
						<li>Out of this line of development came number of important building blocks for HCI such as: </li>
						<ul>
							<li>The mouse</li>
							<li>Bitmapped displays</li>
							<li>Personal computers</li>
							<li>Windows</li>
							<li>The desktop metaphor</li>
							<li>Point and click editors</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>What is HCI</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is HCI</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>HCI is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computer are or are not developed for successful interactions with human beings.</li>
						<li>A user interface is how human interacts with a computer.</li>
						<li>BUT, HCI goes beyond designing screens and menus</li>
						<ul>
							<li>They make it easier to use</li>
							<li>Study the <font color="red">reasoning</font> behind building specific funtionality into computers and the long term effects that systems will have on humans</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is HCI Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It's a very broad discipline that encompasses different specialities with different concerns regarding computer developers.</li>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> concerns with the application design and engineering of the human interfaces</li>
							<li><strong>Sociology and Anthropology:</strong> concerns with the interactions between technology, work and organization and the way that human systems and technical systems mutually adapt to each other</li>
							<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> concerned with the safety of computer systems and the safe limits of human cognition and sensation</li>
							<li><strong>Psychology:</strong> concerned with the cognitive processes of humans and the behavior of users</li>
							<li><strong>Linguistics:</strong> concerned with the development of human and machine languages and the relationship between the two</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>What Is HCI Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>As computers become more and pervasive in culture, designers are increasingly looking to ways to make interfacing with devices easier, safter and more efficient.</li>
						<li>Computer users today would argue that computer makers are still not paying enough attention to making their product "user-friendly".</li>
						<li>Computer system developers might argue that computers are extremely complex products to design and make.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The demand for the services that computers can provide has always outdriven the demand for ease of use.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>Impact of HCI on Society, the Economy and Culture</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Society</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The main impact that HCI has had on society is improving the ease of use of computers and other devices.</li>
						<li>HCI designers and developers makes and improve computers, tablets and mobile phones.</li>
						<li>Modern electronics do not require the user to have much training in order to control the functions of the computers.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Whereas past generation, users has to use command line interfaces</li>
							<center><img height="300" src="images/commandline.png"></center>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Society Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>User Interface (UI) designers try to ensure that the input and output processes are as simple and easy for the user as possible.</li>
						<li>Example: touch screen technology</li>
						<ul>
							<li>It has become very popular in portable devices like mobile phones and tablets.</li>
							<li>These developments are designed to move towards making electronics devices more friendly to users.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Specifically, people who are not experienced with devices like this and usually find them too complicated to use.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>These developments are designed to make these devices more accessible for these poeple and to increase the amount of people that are able to use these products.</li>
						</ul>
						<center><img height="200" src="images/touchscreen.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Society Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>There have also been developments designed to help people with disabilities or impairments to use electronic devices.</li>
						<li>Text to speech technology on computers and audio descriptions on televisions exist for people who have sight problems.</li>
						<li>Developments have also been made for military applications.</li>
						<li>Remote control drones can now be used for reconnaissance, search and destroy or searching collapsed buildings.</li>
						<li>This is a much safer way to go about these missions than sending in real people.</li>
						<center><img height="200" src="images/speech.jpg"> <img height="200" src="images/drone.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Economy</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>HCI impacted the economy by improving peoples productivity in the work place.</li>
						<li>It has increased people's productivity massively.</li>
						<li>Improvement of robotics</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Allow manufacturers to have full robotic operated factories that carry out manual labor for free, fast and efficiently.</li>
							<li>Factory machines are in mamy ways easier to use than human workers on production lines for things like car.</li>
						</ul>
						<center><img height="300" src="images/carmachine.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Economy Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Communication between companies are easily transferable and exchanged through the internet.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The distribution of documents and other files has become much easier thanks to technologies like email and text messages.</li>
							<li>Smartphone technology takes this further since documents can be edited and sent while the user is on the go.</li>
							<center><img height="400" src="images/dropbox.png"></center>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Economy Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Many companies have now set up E-Commerce websites which allow them to sell their items online.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This has many advantages over a regular retail sotre.</li>
							<li>Users can simply visit the website, browse the products available and purchase whatever they want.</li>
						</ul>
						<center><img height="250" src="images/amazon.png"></center>
						<li>Many types of input can be sped up with HCI development.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Things like barcodes need to be read faster for more efficient operation in shop.</li>
							<li>Without this kind of speed, much more time would be spent at the checkout of a store.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Culture</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>HCI impacted the culture by taking down the language barrier.</li>
						<li>It's helpful for having a conversation with someone from a different tongue.</li>
						<li>It helps companies communicate to other international when making business deals or checking on reports and manufacturing.</li>
						<center><img height="300" src="images/reports.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Culture Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Moore's Law states that computer power will double every two years.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This means that the amount of tasks that electronic devices will become more varied and complex as time goes on.</li>
							<li>They will continue to become more and more integrated into our lives.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>People no longer have to wash clothes with their hands since machines such as wasing machines are available.</li>
						<li>Younger children exposed to a lot of technology does not play a lot with toys that older generation used to.</li>
						<li>Hard books are being taken over by electronic version that will never damage the book.</li>
						<center><img height="250" src="images/kidstechnology.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>Example</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Example</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Developing a prototype of an interface that is evaluated and then rebuilt and reassessed iteratively until the final interface has been designed.</li>
						<li>The user is seen as being integral to this process.</li>
						<li>Many issues are highly debated such as:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Methods that are most effective or economical, the point at which these methods should be applied or the value of prescribing a methodology at all.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>There are three major design approaches within HCI:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>User centered design</li>
							<li>Cognitive modeling</li>
							<li>Participatory design</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Interaction between users and computers occurs at the user interface, which includes both software and hardware.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Example Con't</h2>
					<center><img height="500" src="images/Example1.png"></center>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Example Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The previous figure shows how the humans interact with the computers.</li>
						<li>From the computer science perspective, the focus is on the interaction and specifically on the interaction between one or more humans and one or more computational machines.</li>
						<li>The classical situation that comes to mind is a person using an interactive graphics program on a workstation.</li>
						<li>Because HCI studies human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side.</li>
						<li>On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages and development environments are relevant.</li>
						<li>On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines, linguistics, social science, cognitive psychology and human performance are relevant.</li>
						<li>Of course, engineering and design methods are relevant.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>Pros and Cons</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Pros</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Affect the usuability of products and make them easier to use.</li>
						<li>Help the economy</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Example: companies using voice input to direct the caller to a representative</li>
							<li>Save time and money</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Help the culture</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Example: household appliances change how culture work and live</li>
							<li>Simple idea of adding wheels to the vacuum cleaner makes it easier to use</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Easier to communicate with people viz the internet</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Reduce the need to talk face to face</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cons</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Youngster using and learning from touch screen will prevent them to understand how to operate a physical kayboard effectively.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>They will feel lost when trying to use a computer in the workspace.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>With voice command, it will limit the user the ability to find information themselves.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>They will become dependent on technology to do their thinking and other task for them.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>It can limit people's creativity and thinking process.</li>
						<li>Not being able to talk face to face leads to the loss of professionalism.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>Importance in Software Engineering</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Importance in Software Engineering</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Software engineering must work together with HCI to produce a product.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The methodologies should reveal the relevant points of contact between the disciplines.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Methodologies produced by the two disciplines vary greatly in their effectiveness in providing direction for combining methods (or techniques) from both disciplines.</li>
						<li>HCI is seen as useful for the development of the software requirements.</li>
						<li>Software Engineering is a multi-perspective group focusing on a single problem: How to help develop software that is effective and accurate.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>HCI will help developers understand what is effective and accurate.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Interaction with humam beings is increasingly recognized and promoted as an important aspect of software systems and products.</li>
						<li>More and more professionals in the computering industry calls for integrating HCI engineering with software engineering.</li>

					<h2>Eliminate Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Everything that does not add value to the customer is waste, such as</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unnecessary code or functionality</li>
							<li>Slow or ineffective communication</li>
							<li>Defects and quality issues</li>
							<li>Unclear or constantly changing requirements</li>
						</ul>
						<li>In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be achieved without it, it is waste.</li>
							<li>If the partially done code is abandoned during the development process, it is waste.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><u>Waste removal</u> should take place iteratively until seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated.</li>
					</ul>  
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Increase Feedback</h2>
					<strong>Amplify Learning</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This is the best approach for improving a software development environment.</li>
						<li>Instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, different ideas could be tried by writing code and building.</li>
						<li>Learning process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each iteration is coupled with refactoring and integration testing.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>During these short iterations, both customer representatives and the development team learn more about the domain problem and figure out possible solution for further development.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This helps the customer better understand their needs based on the existing result of development efforts.</li>
							<li>The developers learns how to better satisfy those needs.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>	
					<h2>Increase Feedback Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Tools to help include constant feedback and tests that are not overly documented or studied but tried and observed</li>
						<li>Short iterations are also helpful to keep the team constantly working and learning</li>
						<li>Synchronization test that requires daily testing and high level of communication</li>
						<li>Set based development, which focuses on communicating constraints and options to find solutions</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Delay Commitment</h2>
					<strong>Decide As Late As Possible</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Better results should be achieved with an options based approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions.</li>
						<li>The more complex a system is, the more capacity for change should be built into it.</li>
						<li>This does not mean that no planning should be involved.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Planning activities should be concentrated on the different options and adapting to the current situation as well as clarifying confusing situations by establishing patterns for rapid action.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Delay Commitment Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Know what is critically important for the domain</li>
						<li>Practice Object Oriented Design</li>
						<li>Options Thinking - build with options in mind</li>
						<img src="images/decidelate.jpg">
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Deliver Fast</h2>
					<strong>Deliver As Fast As Possible</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received and incorporated into the next iteration.</li>
						<li>The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team.</li>
						<li>With speed, decisions can be delayed.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Speed assures the fulfilling of the customer's present needs and not what they required yesterday.</li>
							<li>Gives them the opportunity to delay making up their minds about what they really require until they gain better knowledge.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Customers value rapid delivery of a quality product.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Build Integrity In</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Pair Programming</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Seeks to avoid quality issues by applying the minds of two developers to each task.</li>
							<li>Combined the experience of two developers instead of one.</li>
							<li>Often results in better productivity as they see solutions that on their own they might not have done.</li>
							<li>Improved quality, since one person can be thinking slightly ahead of the other, catching issues before they occur.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Test Driven Development</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Write the tests before writing the code.</li>
							<li>This prevent quality issues from happening.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Build Integrity in Con't</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Perceived Integrity is affected by the customer's whole experience of a system</li>
							<ul><li>Smaller systems developed by a single team with access, short iterations, customer tests</li></ul>
							<li>Conceptual Integrity means that the system's central concepts work together as a smooth cohesive whole</li>
							<ul><li>Remove complexity in the design and use integrated problem solving to understand the problem and solve the problem at the same time</li></ul>
							<center><img src="images/integrity.jpg"></center>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Build Integrity In Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Constant Feedback</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Develop in small incremental steps and through close collaboration.</li>
							<li>This provide the opportunity for constant 2-way feedback between the Product Owner and the team.</li>
							<li>This feedback can be valuable to ensure the right level of quality.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Minimize Time Between Stages</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Building quality into the development process is to minimize the time between development, testing and bug fixing.</li>
							<li>Do not log the bug. Instead, deal with them immediately.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Frequent Iterations</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Continuous integration, with code integrated into the overall system, built and automatically unit tested as soon as it is checked in.</li>
							<li>Minimizing this gap also reduces integration waste.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Empower the Team</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Managers are taught how to listen to the developers</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Managers can explain better about what actions might be taken.</li>
							<li>Managers can provide suggestions for improvements.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>"Find good people and let them do their own job"</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Encourage progress, catching errors and removing impediments, but not micro-managing.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>People need motivation and a higher purpose to work for.</li>
						<li>Developers should be given access to the customer.</li>
						<li>Team leader should provide support and help in difficult situations as well as ensure that skepticism does not ruin the team's spirit.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Empower the Team Con't</h2>	
					<ul>
						<li>Lean assumes that teams are mature:
							<ul>
								<li>A mature organization looks at the whole system and doesn't only focus on optimizing desperate or separate parts</li>
								<li>A mature organization focuses on learning effectively and empowers the people who do the work to make decisions</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li>Team members should design their own working procedures i.e., self-determination</li>
						<li>In order to motivate their work must be clear and achievable</li>
						<li>Teams need Project Leaders (Program Managers), Master Developers, and Respected Leaders</li>
						<li>Managers track and control whereas Leaders cope with change, set direction and enable motivation</li>
						<li>Mentorship and pair programming enable communities of expertise to develop and be fostered</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>May and Tom Poppendieck gives 2 examples of the software engineering tendency to sub-optimize:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Vicious Circle Number 1</li>
							<ul>
								<li>A customer wants some new features "yesterday".</li>
								<li>The developers hears what the customer wants and gets their request done fast and at all cost.</li>
								<li>Result: There are sloppy changes made to the code.</li>
								<li>The complexity of the code base and the number of defects in the code increases.</li>
							</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole Con't</h2>
						<ul>			
							<li>Vicious Circle Number 2</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Testing is overloaded with work.</li>
								<li>Result: Testing occurs a long time after the code is originally written, or testing is reduced.</li>
								<li>Developers do not get immediate feedback or some things are not properly tested.</li>
								<li>There are more defects in the code and testers have more work.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole Con't</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Systems Thinking and Systems Dynamics say that a system is not just a sum of it's parts, it a product of those interactions</li>
							<li>A rigid and sequential process may cure one symptom but will not treat the root cause.</li>
							<li>Treating the symptoms and not the cause is a common pattern that becomes more likely with larger, more complex systems</li>
							<li>Important to avoid in order to see the overall benefit for the system as a whole</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean seeks to optimize the whole value stream and not just individual functions or teams.</li>
						<li>The best way to organize teams is for them to be multi-disciplined with co-located product teams that have all the roles and skills they need to deliver a request from start to finish, without reference to other teams.</li>
						<li>Putting all of this together can be extremely significant not only in terms of the team's performance, but also in terms of the quality of the product, which ultimately can make your organization more competitive.</li>
					</ul>

				<section><h2>IV. Importance, Pros and Cons of Lean in Software Development</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean offers insight into strategies for improving our software process.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Ex: By understanding the source of waste in IT, we can begin to identify it and then eliminate it.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Lean principles provide a philosophical foundation for scaling agile approaches.</li>
						<li>Provides techniques for identifying waste.</li>
						<li>Helps calculate overall time efficiency of what we are doing.</li>
						<li>Lean developers can build software better and cheaper than competitors using traditional methods.</li>
						<li>The method emphasize on:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Building only what is needed</li>
							<li>Eliminating anything that does not add value</li>
							<li>Stopping production if something goes wrong</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits to the Lean Method</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Improved Quality</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A lot of activities are geared towards improving quality.</li>
							<li>As quality issues arise, problem solving techniques are used to solve the root of the problem.</li>
							<li>Mistake proofing is used to strengthen the process and prevent recurrence.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Improved Visual Management</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If management by sight is done correctly, the entire area can be evaluated with a visual scan.</li>
							<li>Any defects will stand out and be easy to identify as a problem.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Increased Efficiency</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Line balancing will ensure each person in the process is working in the most efficient manner.</li>
							<li>Standardized work will ensure they are doing it correctly, following the same method every time.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Manpower Reductions</li>
						<ul>
							<li>One of the major benefits is getting more done with less people.</li>
							<li>The freed up people can be used to perform further kaizen (practice of continuous improvement) activity, training to enhance skill level, or maintenance of the system once it is implemented.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Easier to Manage</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The work instructions and standardized work let people know what they have to do and when to do it.</li>
							<li>This makes managing and area easier and problems will still arise.</li>
							<li>But, the problems will be much easier to deal with in a team environment where the support groups are eager to help solve problems.</li>
						<li>Increased possibility of delivering product early. Lean helps development teams deliver more functionality in a shorter period of time, hence enabling more projects to be delivered.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Total Company Involvement</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Lean is meant to involve the whole company and not intended to be put into action in only one area.</li>
							<li>This helps promote the concept that everyone in the company is part of the team.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Problem Elimination</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Forces you to attack an issue and continue to investigate it until it has been eliminated.</li>
							<li>This ensure that a problem receives the level of attention it deserves to correct it.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Reduced Space</li>
						<ul>
							<li>With the reduction of waste, space are created.</li>
							<li>Reduction of finished and raw inventory will save space vertically in your ranking as well as horizontally across your floor.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Safer Work Environment</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Visual management and 5S will help identify when things are out of place.</li>
							<li>When unnecessary elements are removed, the workplace becomes more organized and an organized work environment is a safer working environment.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Improved Employee Morale</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This benefits may not be realized during the initial stages of the implementation.</li>
							<li>Employee involvement and empowerment will make all members of the company feel like a contributing part of the team.</li>
							<li>Reducing uncertainty in the workplace will reduce stress in the team members and lead to improved employee morale.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Challenges to the Lean Method</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Resistance</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Changes are seen as evil and unnecessary.</li>
							<li>Long term employees love to live in their comfort zone and will be tough to convert to the new lean culture.</li>
							<li>It takes a lot of effort to convince people about the changes and how the company and its employees will benefit from the changes.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Cost</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes money has to be spent in order to make/save money.</li>
							<li>Mistake proofing processes will cost money.</li>
							<li>Redesign of equipment to facilitate new line balancing will cost money.</li>
							<li>BUT over time, these improvements will pay for themselves through increased quality and reduced defects.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Challenges Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Upkeep</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Levelized production requires regular updating and maintenance.</li>
							<li>With proper execution in the general labor area, you should be able to free up people to fill these roles.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Initial Labor Increase</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Additional resources will be require to implement lean.</li>
							<li>Initially temporary workers can be used to free up some full time folks to implement the system.</li>
							<li>These people can be utilized to carry on the implementation of lean as well as the upkeep later on.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Team Cohesiveness</li>
							<ul><li>The method is highly dependent on motivated individuals and strong teamwork, which can be difficult to create and maintain.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>The Lean Model in Healthcare</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The Lean model has found many fans in the healthcare realm as,
						<blockquote>Whether building a car or providing health care for a patient, workers must rely on multiple, complex processes to accomplish their tasks and provide value to the customer or patient. Waste — of money, time, supplies, or good will — decreases value.</blockquote></li>
						<li>Additionally, in health care the lean model can have a positive impact on productivity, cost, quality, and timely delivery of services.</li>

					<h2>7 Types of Waste (more information)</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol>
							<li>Over Production</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Over production is to manufacture an item before it is actually required.</li>
								<li>It prohibits the smooth flow of materials and degrades quality and productivity.</li>
								<li>The simple solution is to schedule and produce only what can be immediately sold/shipped and improved machine changeover/set-up capability.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Unnecessary Transportation</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Excessive movement and handling cause damage and are an opportunity for quality to deteriorate.</li>
								<li>Transportation can be difficult to reduce due to the perceived costs of moving equipment and processes closer together.</li>
								<li>The solution is to map the product flow to make it easier to visualize.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>7 Types of Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol start = 3>
							<li>Inventory</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Excess inventory tends to hide problems on the plan floor, which must be identified and resolved in order to improve operating performance.</li>
								<li>Excess inventory increases lead times, consumes productive floor space, delays the identification of problems, and inhibits communication.</li>
								<li>The solution is to achieve a seamless flow between work center and this can improve customer service and slash inventories and their associated costs.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Motion</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This waste is related to ergonomics and is seen in all instances of bending, stretching, walking, lifting, and reaching.</li>
								<li>The solution is to analyze excessive motion and redesigned for improvement with the involvement of plan personnel.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>7 Types of Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol start = 5>
							<li>Defects</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Defects have a direct impact to the bottom line, quality defects resulting in rework or scrap are a tremendous cost to organizations.</li>
								<li>The solution is with employee involvement and Continuous Process Improvement, there will be a huge opportunity to reduce defects.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Over Processing</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Many organizations use expensive high precision equipment which often results in poor plan layout because preceding or subsequent operations are located far apart.</li>
								<li>The solution is to invest in smaller, more flexible equipment where possible, creating manufacturing cells, and combining steps will greatly reduce the waste of inappropriate processing.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>7 Types of Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol start = 7>
							<li>Waiting</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Waiting occurs when the material flow is poor, production runs are too long, and distance between work centers are too great.</li>
								<li>Goldratt has stated that one hour lost in a bottleneck process is one hour lost to the entire factory's output, which can never be recovered.</li>
								<li>The solution is to link processes together so that one feeds directly into the next.</li>
							</ul>
